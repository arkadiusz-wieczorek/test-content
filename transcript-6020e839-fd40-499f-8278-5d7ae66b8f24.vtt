00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:17.784
We had a good class with Miss
Sanchez today - more than good.

00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:19.352
It was really useful.

00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:24.324
It was all about our future,
universities and our careers.

00:00:24.324 --> 00:00:27.460
We had a task: Today's class.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.197
Talk among your friends about the jobs
you want to do when you are older.

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:36.302
It's a chance to ask questions about
diplomas and university courses.

00:00:36.302 --> 00:00:39.139
I don't really like being a schoolchild.

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:41.474
I'll be happier when I become a singer.

00:00:41.474 --> 00:00:43.677
That's always been my plan.

00:00:43.677 --> 00:00:46.880
But I don't know
anything about diplomas.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.716
I need somebody
important to hear me sing.

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:54.220
Don't forget to think about a
second choice of university course.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.856
Your first choice might be full.

00:00:56.856 --> 00:01:00.860
And you might do better in your
examinations than you think.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.630
I enjoyed listening to my classmates.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.266
We've shared our dreams for years.

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:10.470
Some of the jobs my classmates
want sounded great.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.906
Some are a bit strange.

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:14.341
Receptionist.

00:01:14.341 --> 00:01:15.175
Waiter.

00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:16.276
Waitress.

00:01:16.276 --> 00:01:17.243
Manager.

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:18.445
Office worker.

00:01:18.445 --> 00:01:19.779
Factory worker.

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:20.513
Model.

00:01:20.513 --> 00:01:21.481
Writer.

00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:22.349
Boss.

00:01:22.349 --> 00:01:24.184
Biology teacher.

00:01:24.184 --> 00:01:26.453
No one wants to be a cleaner.

00:01:26.453 --> 00:01:29.422
I wonder how much a
Receptionist earns...

00:01:29.422 --> 00:01:33.927
Do you have any colleagues if you are
a Writer, or do you work by yourself?

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:38.331
Some of the occupations my
classmates have chosen sound like fun.

00:01:38.331 --> 00:01:39.966
I want to be a Chef!

00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:41.534
I've decided.

00:01:41.534 --> 00:01:43.069
I'm a good cook.

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:45.405
Some Chefs earn a lot of money.

00:01:45.405 --> 00:01:47.007
Great idea!

00:01:47.007 --> 00:01:51.211
You'll need to study chemistry
when you go to university, Harry.

00:01:51.211 --> 00:01:54.314
Emily said she wanted
to earn lots of money,

00:01:54.314 --> 00:01:57.550
work for a big company
and be a guest speaker

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.253
so she can travel around the world.

00:02:00.253 --> 00:02:03.990
The teacher asked what
occupation would let her do that.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.893
She said she didn't know,
but it's her dream.

00:02:06.893 --> 00:02:11.931
My dad says if you want something
in life, you need to work hard,

00:02:11.931 --> 00:02:16.002
study and take diplomas
as well as dream about it.

00:02:16.002 --> 00:02:17.904
Oh hang on a second!

00:02:17.904 --> 00:02:19.305
What about Oli?

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:22.509
Everyone has decided except Oli.

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:24.644
I almost forgot.

00:02:24.644 --> 00:02:29.049
Oli hasn't decided yet,
but he wants to become a pilot,

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:31.584
a teacher or a police officer!

00:02:31.584 --> 00:02:33.453
Is he serious?

00:02:33.453 --> 00:02:36.156
Can you see Oli driving a police car?

00:02:36.556 --> 00:02:38.091
The lesson was fun.

00:02:38.325 --> 00:02:41.795
It was a great speaking
and thinking activity.

00:02:41.795 --> 00:02:44.364
I listened till the end of the lesson...

00:02:44.364 --> 00:02:45.765
for once!

00:02:45.765 --> 00:02:50.103
It helped us forget about tomorrow's
School Challenge competition...

00:02:50.103 --> 00:02:52.272
for a few minutes!
